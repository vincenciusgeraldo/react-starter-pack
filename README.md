# React Starter Pack
React starter pack is a "ready to use" package to initialize your React project.

#### What's included in this package?
+ **React.Js** : React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. For more information, you can visit [React github page](https://reactjs.org).
+ **Redux** : Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. For more information, you can visit [Redux official page](https://redux.js.org/)
+ **Webpack** : Webpack is a build tool that puts all of your assets, including Javascript, images, fonts, and CSS, in a dependency graph. In this package, we have set up most of the configuration you need to start a React project. To learn more about Webpack, you can visit [Webpack site](https://webpack.js.org/)
+ **SASS** : Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is an extension of CSS that enables you to use things like variables, nested rules, inline imports and more. In this package, we have set up most of the configuration needed to combine SASS with your React project. For more documentation and syntax, you can visit [SASS official page](http://sass-lang.com/)

#### What's the benefit?
